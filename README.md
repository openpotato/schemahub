# OpenPotato SchemaHub

The aim of OpenPotato SchemaHub is to provide a central repository for the various JSON schema specifications at the OpenPotato Project. The schema files are stored under GitHub Pages and can be addressed via `https://schemahub.openpotato.org/<namesspace>/<version-tag>/<schema file>`.

Here is a list of the available schema files:
